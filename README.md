# Sol's RNG Bot
This is a Discord bot that let's you roll for auras like in the Roblox game Sol's RNG (it uses the same auras and some ideas from there too)  

If you'd like, you can add it to a server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1269716422620348532)

There are some things I want to note about this bot:  
1. Right now, there is an issue where the /dev createaura and /dev deleteaura commands do not apply until the bot is restarted. I will fix this eventually (i'm lazy)
2. This bot uses application emojis that I'm not sure will work if you're using a different clientId. If they don't show up properly, replace them yourself or just use the normal ✅, ⚠️, and ❌ emojis if you'd like.
