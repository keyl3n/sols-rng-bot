# Sol's RNG Bot
![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/keyl3n/sols-rng-bot) ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/keyl3n/sols-rng-bot)  
This is a Discord bot that let's you roll for auras like in the Roblox game Sol's RNG (it uses the same auras and some ideas from there too)  

If you'd like, you can add it to a server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1269716422620348532)

There are some things I want to note about this bot:  
1. Right now, there is an issue where the /dev createaura and /dev deleteaura commands do not apply until the bot is restarted. I will fix this eventually (i'm lazy)
2. This bot uses application emojis that that won't work if you're using a different bot account on Discord. If you'd like to fix this, you can use the `yes`, `no`, and `maybe` emojis I've provided in the `images` folder, or you can use the normal ✅, ⚠️, and ❌ emojis if you'd like.
